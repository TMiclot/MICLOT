## Interaction network
 An interaction network represents a motif consisting of residue
pairs, their corresponding secondary structures, and the non-covalent interaction types between their atoms. Depending on the system being studied, an interaction network can either arise from the folding of a protein chain onto itself or from the interface between interacting protein chains.

## Residues pairs types
No [interaction network]() is unchangeable, since variations are visible in the dynamics of any system. This is why we classified the residue pairs into five categories based on their presence in the initial and modified networks.

- **Conserved.** Pairs of residues that are present in both networks.
- **Exchanged.** The two residues forming the pair are already present in the initial network, but only interact in the modified network.
- **Substituted.** One of the two residues forming the pair is already present in the initial network, but the second is not.
- **Lost.** Pairs of residues that are present in the initial network but not in the modified network.
- **Winning.** Pairs of residues that are present in the modified network but not in the initial network. Finally, the use of these definitions introduces a very important concept: the transition from a network another is not necessarily equivalent.
